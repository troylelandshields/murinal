The murinal: http://shldz.us/murinal


### Things to do  - Put your name next to what you work on 
Add popup on click of square that shows stuff:
 - who owns that square if someone owns it 
 - Like a sqaure / dislike a square
 - button to buy it and how much it costs 
 - button to start a drawing on that square 

Ability to ctrl click multiple grids:
- buy all at once 
- draw all the same 
- offer to buy 


When I like a square, I think all other squares that belong to that person that touch that square should also be liked (or disliked).

Improve the drawing experience:
- By building [pixelated-fabric](http://github.com/troylelandshields/pixelated-fabric) we can offer a good experience for drawing pixel style images across each square. I am imaging that when you click a square you can turn on "pixel mode" and decide how many pixels you want (16 x 16, 32 x 32, or 64 x 64). Then you can edit the image in a much more precise way than just the freeform drawing that we reduce to 64 x 64. This will make it easier to continue the same drawing on other plots. (Troy)

Just brain-dumping ideas:
- Show price or something on unowned squares instead of the (x, y) coordinates we have now.
- Add ability to share a particular location (i.e., if I paste http://murinal.com/plot/6/4 into facebook and someone clicks it, plot 6,4 should be centered in their screen.
- Add rewards for getting likes.
- Add ability to make offers to buy and set up offers to sell.
- Add social media sharing buttons?
- Add rewards for sharing links and getting new viewers (perhaps each user gets a ref that we stick on any URL that gets shared and when people visit that link we reward the user associated with that ref).
- Add default starting locations that are used at random when you visit the Murinal, with the exception of your first visit.
- First time visitors should be taken to a portion of the Murinal that has explanations or whatever.
- Add "user profiles". I am imagining we have a huge ass section of the murinal that is user profiles. If I click to view my profile I jump to my section in the profile where I can edit my default image.
- Add default images for users that automatically populate plots they have bought but haven't yet drawn on.
- Add ability to favorite plots (or maybe we just do this by tracking 'likes').
- Add ability to jump / transport between significant plots (aka, cycle through all plots I own, or cycle through all plots I have favorited).
- When a plot is disliked the image should get cloudier and cloudier until a certain point it is almost black and automatically goes back for sale for 1 point (or whatever).
- Ability to buy more points?
- Promotional plots that we can sell for advertising space? Perhaps have a revenue sharing program with our users where they can choose one of their plots that can be used to show ads and we'll give them a portion of that ad revenue.
- 'Free' spaces that can be drawn on by anyone at anytime, including new users. New users should probably start somewhere with a lot of free spaces so they can jump right in.
- Ability to share other things on a plot; aka blog post, video, links, tweet-like phrase, etc. I'm imagining you click the plot and then you can see if there is some other content there, then click that to expand it. You could have your entire blog spread out all across the murinal and have a treasure map to read it.
- Ability to "follow" other people that you like--maybe you can cycle through their plots like your own.
