### Things to do  - Put your name next to what you work on 
Add popup on click of square that shows stuff:
 - who owns that square if someone owns it 
 - Like a sqaure / dislike a square
 - button to buy it and how much it costs 
 - button to start a drawing on that square 


Ability to ctrl click multiple grids:
- buy all at once 
- draw all the same 
- offer to buy 


When I like a square, I think all other squares that belong to that person that touch that square should also be liked (or disliked).

Improve the drawing experience:
- By building [pixelated-fabric](http://github.com/troylelandshields/pixelated-fabric) we can offer a good experience for drawing pixel style images across each square. I am imaging that when you click a square you can turn on "pixel mode" and decide how many pixels you want (16 x 16, 32 x 32, or 64 x 64). Then you can edit the image in a much more precise way than just the freeform drawing that we reduce to 64 x 64. This will make it easier to continue the same drawing on other plots. (Troy)
